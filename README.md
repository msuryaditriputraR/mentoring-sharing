### Mentoring & Sharing

I have a program called Mentoring & Sharing for new programming students to help them understand the main concept and finally improve their coding skills. This repository to store all of my source code during the mentoring and sharing.

I really happy to share my pieces of experience and knowledge with everyone who needs it.

This program is my contribution to the community to accelerate the digital transformation toward Indonesia's golden age in 2045.

It's totally free and beginner-friendly. Feel free to join us if you want to learn and grow together

May Allah bless us
